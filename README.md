# Pokemon-Soul-Link-Team-Maker
This code uses a blank CSV file that you add in player's Pokemon into. It takes those Pokemon and checks types and base stat totals on a master CSV that contains that information for every Pokemon. Using that infromation it creates every possible pokemon team combination and ranks them by the total BST for each team.
