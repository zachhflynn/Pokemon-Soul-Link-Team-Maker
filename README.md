# Pokemon-Soul-Link-Team-Maker
This code uses a CSV file that you add both player's Pokemon into. It takes those Pokemon and checks types and base stat totals on a master yaml that contains information for every Pokemon. Using that infromation it creates every possible pokemon team combination and ranks them by the total BST for each team. 
**Warning**
Beacuse the code is in python, and python is not the most effiecnt language, if you are trying to calcualte teams with lots of poekomon on either team it can significantly increase the time it takes to load (Max we have seen is 30 min).
